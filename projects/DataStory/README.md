## The Project
 - Steam Users and Their Libraries
 - DataStory[here](https://shenshenl.github.io/cdv-student/projects/DataStory/story/back.html).
 - An animated GIF of your favorite detail of the visualization
  - don't try to include every aspect of your project in one GIF, just **a small aspect that you think looks good** and will make people want to visit it (something that moves, e.g. a transition)
 - This project visualizes the popular games and the size of individual libraries of Steam users. Audiences can see the video game consuming on both macro and micro view.
  - Are you in this game universe?
 - links to the source of the data you used[here](https://www.kaggle.com/tamber/steam-video-games)
  - Excel functions

## The Process

- Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
As one of the users of the Steam, I really like the socialization function provided by this platform. I viewed libraries of my Steam friends and found it is interesting to predict their game preference, and I am also curious about what is the overview of this community.

- What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?

Best selling games before 2019
Size of individual libraries

- Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
I cut down the size of dataset. The origin dataset has over 1w players data, I randomly chose 4000 of them.

- If you had more time, what would you change, improve, add to the project?

The interaction of the user page could be improved.

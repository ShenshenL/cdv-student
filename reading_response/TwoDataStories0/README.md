## Three Good Datasets

[Twelve Million Phones](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/19/opinion/location-tracking-cell-phone.html)

This dataset includes the postion of people when they are using mobile phones. The visualization in the article indicates how huge the database is, but it did not show the change of location as mentioned in the article. I think it is a good topic to create a shifting visualization. However, how to protect peopleâ€™s privacy needs to be carefully considered.

This project is intereting and thought provoking. In this visualization, the developer calculated the arc and degree of the D3 logo. It is not a big dataset but analysing more logos may come up with some fun conclusion.

[codex atlanticus](https://codex-atlanticus.it/#/?lang=EN)

codex atlanticus is the largest collection of da Vinci manuscripts in existence. This visualization shows the content of the manuscript through color blocks. It also shows the date and creation sequence of the manuscript. It's a creative idea to translate complex manuscripts into clear visualization. This idea could be applied to other works such as painting and photography.
